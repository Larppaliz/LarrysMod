This is a simple mod that just has some settings for card drawing and such.

## Toggle Winner Draws
If this option is OFF the **Winner Draws** option will not work and the amount of cards the winner draws is the same amount as every other player.

## Winner Draws
The amount of cards the player who won this round draws.

This option does not matter if there are no winner draws.
example: Winners Need Hugs Too option from Wills Wacky Gamemodes.

## Starting Picks
The amount of cards you get to pick at the start of the game.

Example: You would get to **PICK 2 CARDS** from the **SAME CARD DRAW** on the first draw phase

## Extra Starting Draws
The extra amount of cards the first draw phase has.

This adds on to the PickNCards card draw amount so for example if you have 5 card draws from the PickNCards config and 2 extra starting draws you would draw 7 cards on the first draw phase.
